## Water Calculation Logic

The app automatically calculates water needs based on:
- **3 gallons per person per day** standard
- Entry and exit dates for each camper
- Current date context:
  - **Pre-event**: Shows total budget for purchasing
  - **During event**: Shows current needs for remaining days
  - **Post-event**: Shows final consumption summary
